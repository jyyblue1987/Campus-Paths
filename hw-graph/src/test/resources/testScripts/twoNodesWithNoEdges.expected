# To test if we can have a graph with 2 nodes and no edges

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add 0 edges

# Print out the nodes in the graph along with their outgoing edges (if any)
A contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in A are:
the children of n2 in A are:
