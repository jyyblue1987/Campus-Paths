# To test if we can have a complete graph by adding two nodes and 4 edges

# Create a graph
CreateGraph A

# Add two nodes
AddNode A n1
AddNode A n2

# Add four edges
AddEdge A n1 n1 e11
AddEdge A n1 n2 e12
AddEdge A n2 n2 e22
AddEdge A n2 n1 e21

# Print out the nodes in the graph along with their outgoing edges
