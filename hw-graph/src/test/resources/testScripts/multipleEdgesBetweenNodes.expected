# To test if the graph can support multiple edges between two nodes

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add 6 edges
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in A
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e22 from n2 to n2 in A
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in A
added edge e21a from n2 to n1 in A
added edge e11a from n1 to n1 in A

# Print out the nodes in the graph along with their outgoing edges
A contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e11) n2(e12) n1(e11a)
the children of n2 in A are: n1(e21) n1(e21a) n2(e22)
