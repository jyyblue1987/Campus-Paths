# To test if the graph will allow for duplicate edges (they should not)

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add 2 edges
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in A

# Add duplicate edge
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in A

# Print out the nodes in the graph along with their outgoing edges
A contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e12)
the children of n2 in A are: n1(e21)
