# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there are multiple edges with the same start node, end node, and weight

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph

added edge 0.500 from A to B in graph
added edge 0.500 from A to B in graph
added edge 0.500 from A to B in graph
added edge 0.500 from A to B in graph
added edge 0.500 from A to B in graph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 0.500
total cost: 0.500
