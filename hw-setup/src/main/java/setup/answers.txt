1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test because the code takes in the
number 0 as a negative number. I had to remove the '=' sign right after the '<' sign in order to
correct the code so that it does not take 0 as a negative number.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because the code assumes the number 2 (index 2) to return 1.
Only the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence is 1. To fix this, I had to remove the '='
sign right after the '<' sign in order to correct the code so that it does not include the number 2
when 1 is returned.



3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It failed the testInductiveCase test because instead of adding the previous two terms, the code
subtracts the second term from the first term. To fix it, I had to change the '-' sign to
become the '-' sign between getFibTerm(n - 1) and getFibTerm(n - 2).
