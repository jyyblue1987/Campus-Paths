# check if the output is correct for finding the shortest path when multiple maths are possible

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge a from n1 to n2 in g
added edge b from n2 to n1 in g
added edge c from n4 to n1 in g
added edge d from n3 to n2 in g
added edge e from n2 to n3 in g
added edge f from n3 to n2 in g
added edge h from n1 to n4 in g
added edge i from n4 to n2 in g

path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n2 via a
n2 to n3 via e
