created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge a from n1 to n2 in g
added edge b from n1 to n2 in g
added edge c from n2 to n3 in g
added edge d from n2 to n3 in g
added edge e from n3 to n4 in g
added edge f from n3 to n4 in g

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 via a
n2 to n3 via c
n3 to n4 via e
